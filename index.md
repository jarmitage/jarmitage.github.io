## Jack Armitage

I am a designer, musician and technologist. Currently I am a PhD student [researching craft in digital musical instrument design](http://instrumentslab.org/research/craft), supervised by Dr. Andrew McPherson in the [Augmented Instruments Lab](http://instrumentslab.org), [Centre for Digital Music](http://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk), Queen Mary University of London. I am also part of the open source [Bela](http://bela.io) project for making interactive audio projects.

From August to December 2017 I was a Visiting Scholar at the [Center for Music Technology](http://gtcmt.gatech.edu), Georgia Institute of Technology, working with Prof. Jason Freeman. Before my PhD I was a research engineer at [ROLI](http://roli.com) and [FXpansion](http://fxpansion.com), and before that I completed a BSc in Music, Multimedia and Electronics at the University of Leeds.

I am currently looking for interesting projects and people to work with in 2020 and beyond. So please get in touch!
